## Approval Module Documentation

**Overview**

The Approval Module in the Flatmate project is designed to manage the approval process for property listings. Property owners or users can submit their property details, and the approval team or admin has the authority to review and approve these listings. This ensures that only valid and appropriate listings are displayed on the platform.

 **Workflow**
 
➤ Property Submission:

➛ Users submit their property details through the Flatmate platform.
➛ Submitted properties are initially set to a "Pending" status.

➤ Review by Approval Team/Admin:

➛ The approval team or admin has access to a dedicated admin panel or interface.

➛ The admin panel provides a list of pending property submissions with relevant details.

➛ The approval team reviews each submission for compliance with platform policies and standards.

➤ Approval Process:

➛ The approval team can either approve or reject a property listing.

➛ If approved, the property status is updated to "Approved," and it becomes visible on the platform.

➛ If rejected, the property status remains "Pending," and the user is notified of the rejection along with any feedback.
